# odin-recipes
This is a part of the Odin Project curriculum. I will follow along with the general steps, however will also try to improvise and add my own personal touches along the way. 

I will add elements of everything we've covered so far which includes lists, anchor tags, images, and perhaps some minor css stylings.
