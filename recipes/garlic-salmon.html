    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salmon. </strong>Rich in nutrients, such as Omega 3 fatty acids and protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic + Butter. </strong>A dynamic duo of flavor. It will keep the salmon perfectly moist, ultra flaky and packed with flavor.</li>

        <li><strong>Lemons. </strong>Pairs quite nicely with the salmon and adds a touch of brightness onto the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Beans. </strong>An easy way to sneak some veggies onto the plate. They provide a tender, yet crisp addition to this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes. </strong>For contrasting color, added moisture and classic tomato flavor. </li>


    </ul>
