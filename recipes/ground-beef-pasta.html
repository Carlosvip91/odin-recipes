    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 + 1/2 lbs. ground beef, 85% lean</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons flour (optional)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Worchestire Sauce</li>
        <li>16 oz tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half and half (half cream, half milk)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 pound Rotini pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shred the cheese and set it aside along with the half and half. We don't want those to be cold when we add them to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook and crumble the ground beef over medium heat. Add the onions halfway through and cook until softened. </li>
        <li>Drain grease. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add salt, Worchestire sauce and flour. Stir to combine and cook for 3 minutes to remove raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to clean the bottom of the pan. Add the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes while you start boiling water for the pasta. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook for 7 minutes or per package instructions.</li>
        <li>Slowly add in the half and half to the sauce, stirring as you go.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and slowly sprinkle in the cheese. Stir to combine. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauve. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>

    </ol>
